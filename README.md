AdGen is an AI powered marketing automation platform built to help small and medium businesses create and run digital campaigns without needing designers, agencies, or dedicated marketing teams. It focuses on simplifying Instagram and WhatsApp marketing by turning product information into ready to publish promotional campaigns within minutes.

This project was created to solve a real problem faced by growing MSMEs. Many small businesses depend heavily on Instagram and WhatsApp to acquire customers, but creating creatives, writing captions, and posting regularly takes time and effort. Because of this, they often miss important sales opportunities during festivals, seasonal offers, and product launches.

AdGen aims to remove that friction by automating the entire campaign creation process.

Problem

Most MSMEs struggle with consistent digital marketing execution. Campaign creation usually involves multiple manual steps such as designing creatives, writing captions, coordinating with designers, and posting across platforms.

This leads to several issues:

Delayed campaigns during high impact periods like festivals and sales

Inconsistent posting and reduced online visibility

Dependency on external designers or agencies

Loss of leads and revenue due to slow execution

In India’s festival driven market, timing is critical. Missing a campaign during Diwali, seasonal sales, or local events can directly impact revenue for small businesses.

Target Users

The platform is designed mainly for Indian MSMEs with turnover ranging from small scale to multi crore businesses. It is especially useful for:

Retail stores

D2C brands

Distributors and wholesalers

Service based businesses

Businesses without dedicated marketing teams

These businesses already use WhatsApp and Instagram for customer acquisition but lack the tools to run professional and consistent campaigns quickly.

Solution

AdGen is an AI powered campaign automation platform that converts product details into ready to publish marketing campaigns.

Users simply upload product images and enter offer details. The platform then generates promotional creatives and captions automatically. This allows businesses to run professional marketing campaigns without manual effort or creative dependency.

The focus of the platform is not just content generation but complete campaign execution. Instead of acting like a simple design tool, AdGen works as a marketing assistant that helps businesses maintain consistent and timely communication with customers.
